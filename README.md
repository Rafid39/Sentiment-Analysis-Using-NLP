# Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews

## Project Overview

This project is a **Sentiment Analysis** of customer reviews performed as part of my **Oasis Infobyte Virtual Internship**. The objective was to analyze and classify customer sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) from a dataset of customer reviews. The project also identifies frequent negative keywords to provide actionable insights for businesses, helping them to enhance customer satisfaction by addressing common issues.

## Key Highlights
- **Sentiment Classification**: Analyzed reviews using **RoBERTa** and **VADER** models for sentiment classification.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed data exploration to uncover trends, customer behavior, and key pain points.
- **Frequent Negative Keywords**: Extracted common complaints from negative reviews such as **"poor design," "itchy," "disappointing,"** etc.
- **Review Sentiment Analysis**: Focused on both positive and negative reviews to understand customer feedback.
- **Class Distribution**: Identified which departments or products had the highest percentage of positive and negative reviews.

## Technologies & Libraries Used
- **Python**  
- **RoBERTa (Transformers)**: Pre-trained model used for sentiment classification.
- **VADER (Sentiment Analysis)**: For extracting sentiment scores and identifying key negative words.
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing tasks like tokenization, stopword removal, etc.
- **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset used consists of customer reviews categorized by class (e.g., 'Dresses', 'Jeans', etc.), containing text reviews and their associated ratings.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Reviews were classified into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** categories using **RoBERTa** and **VADER** models.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized the sentiment distribution across different classes and extracted keywords from negative reviews to identify common issues.
4. **Negative Keyword Extraction**: Focused on frequent complaints and problems mentioned by customers in negative reviews, helping businesses identify and address critical areas for improvement.

## Results & Insights
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Identified patterns in customer sentiment across different classes, providing insights into which products or services received the most positive or negative feedback.
- **Key Negative Keywords**: Extracted frequent negative words such as **"itchy," "poor quality," "slow delivery,"** etc., helping businesses understand customer pain points.
- **Class Analysis**: Discovered which departments/products had the highest percentage of negative reviews, offering valuable insights for targeted improvements.
